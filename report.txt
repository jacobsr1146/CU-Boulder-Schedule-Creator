My project is a schedule planer for CU students. It would allow them to put in activities at certain times and even put in activities that
they would like to do but don't know when. My program will take into account the time it would take to get from one location to another
in order to make your schedule the most efficient time wise.
  Data Structure:
      Graph- map/graph of CU main campus.
             calculates the shortest distance from one location to another using Dijkstra's method.
      HashTable- used to hold the schedule data for each day of the week.
      Queue- used to cycle through the different time slots in a day when finding the best time slot for a new activity.
